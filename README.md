# Number-Classification-and-Image-Processing-on-Android-Embedde__Applied-Microprocessor-Lab__2022-fall

- Designed Android Application which can run on embedd system. 

- Used OpenCV, OpenCL, Java, C, Linux and Android.

- Used Mnist Data for number classifitaion

## 📝 Learned Technology and Skills

Applied OpenCV, OpenCL, Java JNI, C, Linux and Android


## 🚀 Result :

- Created Android app on embedd board.

- Used OpenCL to Gaussian BLUR captured image

- Used OpenCV to Edge-detect captured image

- Possible to compare num clacification accuracy among oringal, blurred, edge-detect images

- Also, controlled Linux based Hardwares ( LED, 9-segment, 2 array LCD)
